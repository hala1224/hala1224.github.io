This is my third project and by far most time consumming. The idea for the project to me as a teacher, who has to enter and adjust grades weekly, was easy. The difficult part was the implementation, since I went on to JavaScript section before doing the project.

My design logic for the views was not working due to functionality of Rails, hence **derailment**. Once JavaScript will be added to this app it will be working the way I envisioned, but it took one of Rails section coaches to figure that out. After many weeks of frustrations, study groups, videos and with the suggestions of my coach, it is finally up and running.

Rails is magic when it comes to object relations and associations. It took  many days and hours of debugging in Rails console to realize that. With each project I am realizing that as a student, I am acquiring new set of skills. In this project my new skills are documentation reading and implementing, using code snippets and integrating them into my own code, using relevant google search results by number of comments, etc... 

Next almost derailment in this project - OmniAuth. The facebook OmniAuth did not happen in this project, due to all new security measures. Siffting through all the problems with the implementation and even the russian blogs (yes, I speak and read) did not help. It is not in my character  to quit, but due to time constraints implemented Google instead.

Looking forward to implementing all the features I originaly envisioned for this project in JS with Rails. Many, many thanks to Jen Hansen for her guidance.
