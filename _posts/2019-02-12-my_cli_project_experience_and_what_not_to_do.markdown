***â€œYou can't just turn on creativity like a faucet. ..***"- one of famous quotes for a procrastinator.

I am a procrastinator but a doer. 
Theodore Roosevelts said " **Do what you can, with what you have.."**

So since I did the JavaScript bootcamp, it was easier to  jump to JavaScript section in my cirrucilum than start the project. Now that the section was complete, it was time for the project.

Please do not do what I did! It was much harder to go back to programming in Ruby after JS. I had to review my old labs and syntax and still could not start the project.

If you are in anyway like me, please heed this following advice. 

**Join the CLI project Slack Channel
* Watch the videos on the project page 
* Watch the CLI project videos on ****LearnInstruct **channel
* Join the CLI project study groops
* Get the CLI project checlist and stick to it!


The first hurdle was working in sandbox in IDE. There is a video on the project page to walk you through the process.
Once you got that started make sure to save your code frequently, since IDE is unpredictable sometimes and swithces back to development directory and your code will be lost! So here are the commands to memorize:

*1. git add .
2. git commit -m "your message"
3. git push (no need for origin master now)*


Get used to cloning your repo and keep the Github tab open!
Next hurdle is picking a website to scrape! If you join the CLI study group, Jenn Hansen - technical coach and my hero has a scrape checker on repl.it.
Next hurdle is making sure that the website is consistent throughout. I had a site and was able to scrape 2 levels for 2 options, but since it is a working site it got updated and was loading with JS (which is unscrappable!).

So now you have a site and know how to work in sandbox, it's coding time!
Make sure you know your object relationships, class methods and how to use "your new best friend" **PRY!** 
There isn't any help like ask a question, so the **SLACK** channel is your new resourse and you might be lucky like me and get someone to help you out there or a coach might answer.

PRY was acting out in IDE so I resorted to using "puts" statements. When that wasn't helping, I went back to what I know and coded in repl.it.

My project is done, code is working and output is colorized, but not done yet... 

**Last 2 hurdles:**

1.** Video** - recording and narrating your code. Make sure your dog or kids are not in the room!
2.** Blog** - write about your experience and do not leave any small details out! You never know, someone else might run into the same problem and then you will be the hero!
