Sinatra in Web Development for me was nothing to sing about. This section seemed to have endless labs and videos to watch and some frankly were fascinating and some a waste of time (my opinion). The study groups on the other hand were my life line for this section. The hosts and the students were very helpful. Learn instruct videos were helpful as well.

I kept my project bare bone and simple, but ran into major issues with environment. The past 5 months was working in in browser IDE since my local environment had issues. Well just my luck, the IDE started to freeze, switch back to development and poof went my code right before I hit "push origin master".

Switching to local environment was like Frank Sinatras' song "Night and Day"! 
Followed all the instructions (17 steps) and two hours later the set up on my Mac was complete! Copied the git to the atom and errors I havent seen before! 

Sinatra errors are so pretty! Errors' text is around a microphone. I really want to add sound effects to these errors and have a song playing "Do it my way"! Tried asking questions in "Ask a question", but since it was project related was turned away few times. 

So I went back to IDE and got the project working. Copied the project into atom and still didnt work! Slack Channel to the rescue now. Had to reach out to coaches, section heads and peers. Per coaches suggestion went back to "Ask a question" and after half hour on shared screen zoom session, got it working!

This section really tested my google skills and patience. Old blue eyes has a song for this section "I got you under my skin"!
